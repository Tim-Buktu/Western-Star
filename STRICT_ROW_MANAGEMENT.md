# Strict Row Content Management - No Spillover

## Key Changes Implemented

### ✅ **Fixed Card Heights**

- **Small cards**: `h-[300px]` - No content spillover
- **Medium cards**: `h-[320px]` - Consistent row height
- **Large cards**: `h-[380px]` - Proper content containment

### ✅ **Content Clipping Strategy**

- **Title lines**: Strictly limited with `line-clamp-2` or `line-clamp-3`
- **Summary lines**: Reduced to `line-clamp-2` or `line-clamp-3` maximum
- **Category badges**: `truncate` class prevents text overflow
- **Footer content**: Simplified and `truncate` applied where needed

### ✅ **Layout Improvements**

- **Container spacing**: Reduced to `space-y-6` for tighter row management
- **No flexible heights**: Removed all `h-full`, `flex-grow`, and `items-stretch`
- **Fixed grid structure**: Each pattern uses standard CSS Grid without height manipulation
- **Content overflow**: `overflow-hidden` on content containers

### ✅ **Typography Adjustments**

- **Smaller font sizes**: Reduced font sizes to fit within fixed card heights
- **Tighter margins**: Reduced margins between elements (mb-2, mb-3)
- **Minimal footer**: Simplified footer with essential information only
- **Truncated metadata**: Views shown as "5k" instead of "5,000" to save space

## Benefits
