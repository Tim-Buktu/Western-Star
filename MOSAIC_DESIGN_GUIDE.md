# Apple-Inspired Mosaic Layout System

## Overview

The Western Star news platform now features a sophisticated, Apple-inspired mosaic layout system that creates visually engaging, non-monotonic article arrangements. This system intelligently varies card sizes and layouts to maintain aesthetic appeal while ensuring excellent readability and user experience.

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Content-First Approach**: Layout adapts based on content importance and type
- **Strategic Asymmetry**: Deliberately varied card sizes create visual interest
- **Rhythmic Spacing**: Consistent gaps and proportions maintain visual harmony
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed through smart typography hierarchy

### Apple Newsroom Inspiration

- **Modular Design**: Each layout pattern serves a specific visual purpose
- **Clean Aesthetics**: Generous white space and refined typography
- **Sophisticated Interactions**: Subtle animations and hover effects
- **Mobile-First Responsive**: Graceful degradation across all screen sizes

## Layout Patterns

### 1. Featured Hero Section

**Purpose**: Showcase the most important article

- Full-width hero treatment with overlay text
- Large, immersive imagery with gradient overlay
- Prominent call-to-action and engagement metrics
- Always appears first when articles are available

### 2. Large + Medium + Medium Pattern

**Purpose**: Highlight one major story with two supporting articles

- **Desktop**: 8-column large card + 4-column medium cards (stacked)
- **Mobile**: Single column with responsive image sizing
- Used every 7th pattern cycle or for high-importance content

### 3. Medium + Medium + Small Pattern

**Purpose**: Balance multiple stories of varying importance

- **Desktop**: Two 4-column medium cards + one 4-column small card
- **Tablet**: 2x1 grid for medium cards, full-width small card
- **Mobile**: Single column progression

### 4. Small + Large + Small Pattern

**Purpose**: Frame a central story with supporting content

- **Desktop**: 3-6-3 column distribution
- **Mobile**: Reorders to large-first for better hierarchy
- Creates visual "framing" effect around central content

### 5. Four Small Grid Pattern

**Purpose**: Display multiple related stories efficiently

- **Desktop**: 4-column equal grid
- **Tablet**: 2x2 grid
- **Mobile**: 2x2 grid with smaller cards
- Perfect for category roundups or quick-read content

### 6. Full-Width Breaking News

**Purpose**: Maximum attention for urgent news

- Spans full container width
- Distinctive red color scheme with animated banner
- Horizontal layout on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Guaranteed prominent placement

### 7. Three Equal Pattern

**Purpose**: Standard balanced presentation

- Traditional equal-sized cards
- Fallback pattern ensuring consistent display
- Works reliably across all device sizes

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (lg: 1024px+)

- **12-column grid system** for precise layout control
- **Complex asymmetrical patterns** showcase content hierarchy

- **Full-width cards** for maximum content visibility
- **Optimized image aspect ratios** for smaller screens
- **Compact spacing** (12px gaps) while maintaining clarity

## Technical Implementation

### Pattern Algorithm

```javascript
const createLayoutPattern = (articles) => {
  // Intelligent pattern selection based on:
  // - Article position in array
  // - Article type (breaking-news, feature-story, etc.)
  // - Mathematical progression for visual variety
  // - Content importance signals
};
```

### Key Features
